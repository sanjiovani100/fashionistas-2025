Supabase
Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. A service to:

Listen to database changes.
Query your tables, including filtering, pagination, and deeply nested relationships (like GraphQL).
Create, update, and delete rows.
Manage your users and their permissions.
Interact with your database using a simple UI.
Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Most notably, Supabase uses Postgres rather than a NoSQL store.

## Document Relationships & Cross-References

To minimize duplication while maintaining comprehensive coverage:

- **Vision & Strategy** informs the **Development Roadmap**
- **Product Requirements** references the **Vision & Strategy** for rationale
- **Module Specifications** implement the features defined in the **Product Requirements**
- **Design System** is applied consistently across all modules
- **Technical Architecture** defines how modules integrate
- **AI & Automation Playbook** references specific features from **Module Specifications**

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should exist in only one document
2. **Cross-References**: Use links to reference information in other documents
3. **Version Control**: All documents should be version-controlled
4. **Review Cycles**: Regular reviews to ensure documentation remains current
5. **Ownership**: Assign clear ownership for each document

## Leveraging Existing Content

The existing `prompts.md` file contains valuable content that should be distributed across the new documentation structure:

- Core features → Product Requirements and Module Specifications
- Development stages → Development Roadmap
- Implementation details → Technical Architecture and Module Specifications
- AI features → AI & Automation Playbook

## Additional Documentation Needs

Based on project requirements, consider adding:

1. **API Documentation** - Detailed API reference for developers
2. **Integration Guides** - Step-by-step guides for third-party integrations
3. **User Manuals** - End-user documentation for different user roles
4. **Training Materials** - Onboarding guides for platform administrators
5. **Marketing Collateral** - Feature highlights and benefits for sales teams

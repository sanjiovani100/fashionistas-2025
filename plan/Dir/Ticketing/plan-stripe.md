# Stripe Integration Plan for Fashionistas Event Registration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating Stripe payment processing with the Fashionistas event registration system. Rather than implementing a full e-commerce solution, we'll focus on a streamlined approach specifically designed for event ticketing and registration.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Week 1)

#### 1. Stripe Account Configuration
- **What**: Set up Stripe account and configure webhook endpoints
- **Example**: Create separate test and production environments
- **Benefit**: Enables secure testing without affecting live payments

#### 2. Environment Setup
- **What**: Configure API keys and environment variables
- **Example**: 
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
  ```
- **Benefit**: Secures sensitive credentials and simplifies deployment across environments

#### 3. Install Dependencies
- **What**: Add Stripe SDK and related packages
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js stripe
  ```
- **Benefit**: Provides type-safe access to Stripe APIs and components

### Phase 2: Core Payment Infrastructure (Week 2)

#### 1. API Routes Implementation
- **What**: Create serverless functions for Stripe operations
- **Example**: 
  - `/api/create-checkout-session` - Initiates checkout process
  - `/api/webhook` - Handles Stripe events
  - `/api/payment-intent` - Creates payment intents for custom flows
- **Benefit**: Keeps sensitive operations server-side for security

#### 2. Checkout Session Flow
- **What**: Implement Stripe Checkout for quick deployment
- **Example**: Redirect to Stripe-hosted checkout page with event details
- **Benefit**: Fastest implementation with minimal security concerns

#### 3. Webhook Handler
- **What**: Process Stripe events (payment success, failure, etc.)
- **Example**: Update database when `checkout.session.completed` event occurs
- **Benefit**: Ensures database stays in sync with payment status

### Phase 3: User Interface Components (Week 3)

#### 1. Ticket Selection Interface
- **What**: Create UI for selecting event tickets and quantities
- **Example**: Card-based interface with ticket types, prices, and quantity selectors
- **Benefit**: Provides clear options for users before payment

#### 2. Checkout Button Component
- **What**: Implement button to initiate checkout process
- **Example**: "Purchase Tickets" button that triggers checkout session creation
- **Benefit**: Clear call-to-action for completing purchases

#### 3. Order Confirmation Page
- **What**: Display successful payment confirmation
- **Example**: Thank you page with order details and next steps
- **Benefit**: Confirms successful transaction and improves user confidence

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4-5)

#### 1. Custom Checkout Form (Optional)
- **What**: Replace Stripe Checkout with custom Elements implementation
- **Example**: Branded payment form using Stripe Elements
- **Benefit**: Fully customized checkout experience matching site design

#### 2. Saved Payment Methods
- **What**: Allow returning users to use saved payment methods
- **Example**: Option to use previously saved cards for faster checkout
- **Benefit**: Reduces friction for repeat customers

#### 3. Discount Codes
- **What**: Implement promotional codes for events
- **Example**: Apply percentage or fixed amount discounts to purchases
- **Benefit**: Enables marketing promotions and special offers

#### 4. Subscription Options
- **What**: Implement recurring payments for VIP memberships
- **Example**: Monthly/annual subscription for premium event access
- **Benefit**: Creates predictable revenue stream

│   └── tickets/
│       ├── TicketCard.tsx
│       ├── TicketList.tsx
│       └── PriceDisplay.tsx

```

### Data Flow

1. **User Journey**:
   - User browses events → Selects event → Chooses tickets → Initiates checkout → Completes payment → Receives confirmation

2. **Technical Flow**:
   - Frontend requests checkout session → Backend creates Stripe session → User redirected to Stripe → Payment completed → Webhook received → Database updated → User sees confirmation

3. **Database Updates**:
   - Create pending order on checkout initiation
   - Update order status on webhook confirmation
   - Link order to user account if authenticated

## Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**
   - **What**: Use Stripe Elements or Checkout to avoid handling card data
   - **Example**: Card details never touch our servers
   - **Benefit**: Reduces security requirements and liability

2. **Webhook Verification**
   - **What**: Verify webhook signatures to prevent fraud
   - **Example**: Validate each incoming webhook using Stripe's signature verification
   - **Benefit**: Prevents malicious actors from faking payment events

3. **Idempotency Keys**
   - **What**: Use idempotency keys for API requests
   - **Example**: Include unique key with payment creation to prevent duplicates
   - **Benefit**: Prevents double-charging during network issues

## Testing Strategy

1. **Test Cards**
   - **What**: Use Stripe test cards for different scenarios
   - **Example**: 
     - `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Successful payment
     - `4000 0000 0000 0002` - Declined payment
   - **Benefit**: Tests various payment outcomes without real transactions

2. **Webhook Testing**
   - **What**: Use Stripe CLI to test webhooks locally
   - **Example**: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook`
   - **Benefit**: Tests full payment flow without deploying

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - **What**: Create Cypress tests for checkout flow
   - **Example**: Test from ticket selection through payment completion
   - **Benefit**: Ensures complete user journey works correctly

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Payment Dashboards**
   - **What**: Set up Stripe Dashboard views for monitoring
   - **Example**: Create filtered views for different event types
   - **Benefit**: Easy visualization of payment activity

2. **Error Tracking**
   - **What**: Implement logging for payment errors
   - **Example**: Log details of failed payments for troubleshooting
   - **Benefit**: Quickly identify and resolve payment issues

3. **Conversion Tracking**
   - **What**: Track checkout conversion rates
   - **Example**: Measure percentage of users who complete payment
   - **Benefit**: Identify potential UX issues in checkout flow

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create Stripe account and obtain API keys
   - Set up project environment variables
   - Implement basic checkout session API route

2. **Week 1 Deliverables**
   - Working Stripe Checkout integration for a single event
   - Basic webhook handling for payment confirmation
   - Test payment flow in development environment

3. **Success Criteria**
   - Users can successfully purchase event tickets
   - Payment confirmations correctly update the database
   - Admin dashboard shows accurate payment information
   - 98% payment success rate for attempted checkouts

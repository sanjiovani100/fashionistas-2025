# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Documentation

This directory contains all documentation related to the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the fashion event management platform.

## Directory Contents

- **prd-plan.md**: Comprehensive document containing both the PRD structure overview and generation prompts
- **[module-name]-requirements.md**: Individual module requirement documents (to be created)

## How to Use These Documents

1. Start by reviewing the **prd-plan.md** file to understand:
   - The overall structure and purpose of the PRD
   - The implementation workflow
   - The detailed prompts for generating each section

2. Use the prompts in the second half of **prd-plan.md** to generate content for each section of the PRD.

3. For each module, create a separate requirements document using the corresponding prompts.

4. Finally, compile all sections into a complete PRD document.

## PRD Structure

The complete PRD will include:

1. **Executive Summary & Document Purpose**
2. **Product Overview & Modules**
3. **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** (by module)
   - Event Planning & Management
   - Ticketing & Registration
   - Sponsor Management
   - Marketing & Promotion
   - Analytics & Reporting
4. **Technical Requirements & Constraints**
5. **Non-functional Requirements**

## Development Workflow

1. Generate the Executive Summary and Product Overview first
2. Develop user stories for each module in priority order
3. Define technical and non-functional requirements
4. Review with stakeholders for completeness and accuracy
5. Finalize and baseline the document

## Best Practices

- Use consistent formatting throughout the document
- Ensure all requirements are testable and measurable
- Maintain traceability between requirements and business objectives
- Include visual elements (diagrams, tables) where appropriate
- Keep language clear and concise for all stakeholders

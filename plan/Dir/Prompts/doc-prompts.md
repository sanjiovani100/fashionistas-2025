3. A glossary of terms and abbreviations
4. A version history table
5. A document approval section
6. Visual roadmap overview (timeline visualization)
7. Appendices for detailed supporting information

Ensure the document has:
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Professional language appropriate for stakeholders
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Page numbers and section references
- A cohesive narrative that flows logically from strategy to execution
- Visual elements that make the roadmap easy to understand at a glance

The final document should provide clear direction for the development team while also serving as a communication tool for business stakeholders to understand the implementation plan, timeline, and expected outcomes.

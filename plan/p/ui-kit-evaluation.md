| Components/Blocks | $29 | Access to all components and blocks |
| Templates Pro | $49 | Access to all website templates |
| All-access | $139 (discounted) | Complete access to all current and future assets |

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Integration Approach**
   - We could adopt the entire kit structure
   - We could cherry-pick specific components and templates
   - We could use it as reference/inspiration while building custom components

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Team would need to familiarize with the component APIs
   - Documentation quality needs evaluation
   - May require some refactoring of existing code

3. **Customization**
   - Need to assess how easily we can customize to match Fashionistas branding
   - Determine if we can extend the components without breaking updates

## Most Relevant Templates/Dashboards

1. **E-Commerce Dashboard**
   - Potential adaptation for ticket sales and event management

2. **Project Management Dashboard**
   - Could be modified for fashion show planning and coordination

3. **Portfolio Template (Neofolio)**
   - Potential use for designer profiles and collection showcases

4. **SaaS Landing Page Template (Cosmic)**
   - Could be adapted for the Fashionistas main landing page

## Next Steps

1. Review example demos of each template
2. Determine if purchasing components only or full access makes more sense
3. Create a sample integration with one component to test compatibility
4. Make final decision by [TARGET DATE]
